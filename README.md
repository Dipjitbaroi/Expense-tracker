# Expense Tracker

The application tracks income and expenses. Users can enter income and expense data through a form, and view them in two separate lists. The app calculates and displays the total balance, total income, and total expenses based on user inputs. It also allows sorting of income and expense lists by amount, both from high to low and low to high, as well as filtering based on category. Users can edit or delete individual items from the income and expense lists, with the updated balance reflected in the balance summary after each change.
